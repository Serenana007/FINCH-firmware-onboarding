# Firmware Onboarding

Welcome to the onboarding repo. This is where you'll work on your first project. Check with the firmware lead or relevant resources on what to do.

## A note for Firmware lead

To keep, this repo clean, each year a new branch should be forked from `main`, and set as the default. Members can then clone and push to this branch.
